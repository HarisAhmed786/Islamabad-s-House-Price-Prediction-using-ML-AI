# Islamabad-s-House-Price-Prediction-using-ML-AI
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent to predict house prices in Islamabad, based on a real-world dataset scraped from Zameen.com. No machine learning library (such as sklearn) is used for training — the entire learning algorithm is implemented manually using mathematical formulas.
